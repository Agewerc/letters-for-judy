# letters-for-judy
A personal AI-powered project to preserve, transcribe, and explore my grandmother Judy’s lifetime of handwritten letters. Over 300 letters exchanged with family and friends — digitized, processed with AI for transcription, topic discovery, and storytelling — and shared through an interactive web app.
